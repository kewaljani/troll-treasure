# Treasure Troll Solution

This is a solution for the treasure troll problem, where a troll must navigate a randomly generated map to reach a tower and obtain a golden treasure. The troll can stack blocks to build a staircase and must do so in as few moves as possible.

## Solution Overview
The solution uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore the map and find the shortest path to the tower. At each cell, the algorithm evaluates the possible actions (move left, right, up, or down, pick up a block, or drop a block) and generates new states accordingly. The algorithm keeps track of the visited cells and the current state of the troll (position, carried blocks, and number of moves).

Once the algorithm finds the tower, it retraces the steps from the goal state to the initial state to generate the optimal sequence of actions. The sequence is then returned to the game engine to execute.

## Implementation Details
The solution is implemented in JavaScript and uses the provided Stacker class. The Stacker class has one method, turn, which takes as input the current cell information and returns a string representing the chosen action.

The solution uses a queue data structure to implement the breadth-first search algorithm. The queue stores the states of the troll as objects with the following properties:

pos: an object with the x and y coordinates of the troll
blocks: an array of objects representing the carried blocks, with the x and y coordinates and the level of the block
moves: the number of moves taken to reach the current state
action: the action taken from the parent state to reach the current state (e.g., "up", "down", "pickup", or "drop")
parent: a reference to the parent state
The algorithm initializes the queue with the initial state of the troll and continues until it finds the tower or exhausts all possible states. Once the goal state is found, the algorithm retraces the steps from the goal state to the initial state by following the parent references and generating the corresponding sequence of actions.

## Usage
To use the solution, copy the code from solution.js and paste it into the provided text box in the game engine. The game engine will automatically call the turn method of the Stacker class at each turn and pass in the current cell information.

## Performance
The solution uses a breadth-first search algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (the number of possible actions from each state) and d is the depth of the goal state. In the case of the treasure troll problem, the branching factor is at most 6 (4 movements, pickup, and drop) and the depth of the goal state is at most the size of the map. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is O(6^m), where m is the number of cells in the map.

In practice, the solution explores only a subset of the possible states, as it prunes the search tree when it encounters previously visited cells or invalid states (e.g., trying to pick up a block when the troll is already carrying two blocks). Therefore, the actual time complexity depends on the size and complexity of the map and the position of the tower. On average, the solution should find the tower and the optimal sequence of actions in less than 1000 steps.

## Conclusion
The treasure troll problem is a challenging puzzle that requires careful planning and algorithmic thinking to solve optimally. The solution presented here uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore the map and
